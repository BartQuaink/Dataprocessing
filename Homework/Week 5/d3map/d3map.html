      As it was mostly not an issue of selecting a good colour scheme or playing around with interactivity, the biggest problem was actually getting all the data to work properly and the actual displaying of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've been having a lot of trouble loading in all the libraries and getting them to work, donwloading them didn't work, I couln't host my own website, for which I had to download a new application and a lot of general errors containing simple linking of the .js libraries.
      Because this took a lot of my time, I didn't finish all of my ideas which I had prior to starting this homework exercise.
      </p>
      I really wanted to implement an interactive legend, which didn't work yet.
      <p>
      The map display is too big in my opinion, but I couldn't find a solution for that as well.
      The colouring scheme is a simple gradient from dark red to greenish. I'm quite satisfied with that.
      </p>
      The tooltip is one of the things I wanted to fix as well, the population contained comma's for easier readability, but while loading in the data this has proven to be really difficult because the file is a comma seperated file, and loading strings was quite the difficult task. That's one of the other things I'd like to have changed before handing in this assignment, but there was a lack of time.
